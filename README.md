# Challenge18-SocialAPI

## Description
This week, I created a social network API from scratch. As shown in the packages, I used Express.js for routing and MongoDB for the database. This application allows users to share their thoughts, create a friends list, and react to their friends' thoughts. MongoDB worked perfectly for this social network API because it can handle large amounts of data very quickly, and has flexibility for data that is unstructured. Knowing how to utilize MongoDB in this setting is crucial for being a full-stack developer due to the astounding number of social networking platforms that exist today.
